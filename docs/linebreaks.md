# [Semantic Line Breaks Specification (SemBr)](https://sembr.org/)

> When writing text with a compatible markup language, add a line break after each substantial unit of thought.

## Introduction
Semantic Line Breaks describe a set of conventions for using insensitive vertical whitespace to structure prose along semantic boundaries.

Many lightweight markup languages, including Markdown, reStructuredText, and AsciiDoc, join consecutive lines with a space. Conventional markup languages like HTML and XML exhibit a similar behavior in particular contexts. This behavior allows line breaks to be used as semantic delimiters, making prose easier to author, edit, and read in source â€” without affecting the rendered output.
