# [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

* [Example of collapsable sections with code](https://gist.github.com/pierrejoubert73/902cc94d79424356a8d20be2b382e1ab)
* [Article with different configurations](https://www.endtoend.ai/tutorial/collapsible-code-blocks/)

Two important rules:

Make sure you have an empty line after the closing </summary> tag, otherwise the markdown/code blocks won't show correctly.
Make sure you have an empty line after the closing </details> tag if you have multiple collapsible sections.
